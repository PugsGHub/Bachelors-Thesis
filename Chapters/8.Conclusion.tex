Thirty-one years ago, Dick Feynman told me about his ‘‘sum over histories’’ version of quantum mechanics. ‘‘The electron does anything it likes,’’ he said. ‘‘It just goes in any direction at any speed,… however it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the wavefunction.’’ I said to him, ‘‘You’re crazy.’’ But he wasn’t.
